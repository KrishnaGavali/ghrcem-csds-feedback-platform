## What's this about?

So here's the thing - my professor came to me one day super frustrated about creating feedback forms. Every semester, faculty had to manually set up Google Forms with the same 12 questions for every teacher, every subject. We're talking 100+ questions per division, taking them 4+ hours just to set up forms.

I thought, "There's gotta be a better way to do this," and built a system that does it all in 30 seconds.

## The problem (and why I cared)

**Before my system:**

- Faculty spent 8+ hours per semester just creating forms
- Same questions, different teacher names - super repetitive
- Responses scattered across multiple Google Forms
- No way to see trends or get insights
- Manual work to compile everything for reviews

**After building this:**

- Generate complete forms in 30 seconds
- All responses in one place
- Real-time analytics and insights
- Department-wide efficiency improvement

## How it started

My professor literally walked up to me and said, "Krishna, this feedback form creation is driving me crazy. Can you help?"

Instead of just solving it for him, I realized this was probably a problem for anyone who has to create these forms. So I built something that could work for the entire department.

Showed it to our HOD, and she was genuinely impressed (which was surprising since I'm usually on her not-so-good list ðŸ˜…). Now they're considering using it department-wide.

Planning to pitch this to other departments too - wish me luck! ðŸ¤ž

## What it does

**For Teachers:**

- Create feedback forms by just entering name, subject, branch, year
- Watch student submissions come in real-time
- Get analytics on feedback trends
- Share forms with students via unique links

**For Students:**

- Fill forms quickly on any device
- No registration needed - just click and submit
- Clean, simple interface

**For Admins:**

- See department-wide feedback data
- Generate reports and insights
- Track performance across batches

## Tech stuff

- **Frontend:** React (because it's what I'm comfortable with)
- **Backend:** Appwrite (free tier friendly)
- **Database:** Appwrite database
- **Hosting:** Vercel (free and fast)
- **Auth:** Simple email-based login

Nothing too fancy - I wanted to build something that actually works and doesn't cost money to run.

_Yeah, I know the reports UI looks pretty basic, but there's a reason for that! The professor specifically wanted these pages to be print-friendly for college paperwork. So I had to keep the design simple and clean for PDF printing. Trust me, I can build way better-looking dashboards when I don't have to worry about print layouts! ðŸ˜…_

## Why I'm proud of this

- **Actual impact:** Saving real people real time every semester
- **Real users:** Faculty are actually using this (or will be soon)
- **Problem-solving:** Saw a bigger picture from one person's complaint
- **Scalable thinking:** Built for one professor, designed for the whole department

## What's next?

- Maybe expand to other departments if this works well
- Add some ML insights (if I can figure that out)
- Mobile app could be cool
- Integration with college's existing systems

## Random thoughts

This project taught me that sometimes the best ideas come from people complaining about their daily problems. My professor's frustration became my opportunity to build something meaningful.

Also learned that building for real users (who will actually tell you when something sucks) is way different than building pet projects that only you see.
